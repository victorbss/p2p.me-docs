## Merchant Readiness

Before operating, ensure you have the following.

- A wallet connected through a supported client/admin interface.
- Required settlement liquidity for supported currency operations.
- Active payment rails/accounts you can operationally maintain.

---

## Merchant Setup Flow

### Step 1 Register and Stake

1. Register as merchant for an active currency.
2. Stake required settlement liquidity.
3. Confirm your merchant profile and operational status.

### Step 2 Add Payment Channels

1. Add payment channels for your supported rails.
2. Wait for required approval states.
3. Keep approved channels active and up to date.

```

## Handling Orders

### Accepting Orders

1. Monitor assigned orders.
2. Accept orders promptly.
3. Follow the settlement steps by order type.

### Completing Orders

- Confirm payment actions as required by the flow.
- Ensure finalization steps are completed in-app.
- Keep records/evidence for dispute scenarios.

---

## Operational Controls

As a merchant, you should routinely perform the following.

- Keep channels active only when you can service them.
- Maintain sufficient liquidity for expected order load.
- Monitor order states and ongoing-order constraints.
- Withdraw accrued fees via supported flow.
- Use unstake/request flows when reducing or exiting activity.

## Circles of Trust

A Circle of Trust is a community-backed collective of merchants operated by a Circle Admin. Each Circle functions as a semi-autonomous unit within the protocol, managing its own merchant network while adhering to shared on-chain protocol rules.

Circles organize merchants into accountable groups, enable community oversight through staking and delegation, and distribute risk through tiered insurance pools.

```mermaid

    user[UserOrder]
    orderFlow[OrderFlowFacet]
    registry[MerchantRegistry]
    country[CountryConfig]
    assignment[EligibilityAndAssignmentChecks]
    settlement[SettlementAndAccounting]

    user --> orderFlow
    orderFlow --> registry
    orderFlow --> country
    registry --> assignment
    country --> assignment
    assignment --> settlement
```

The merchant registry is the operational core that Circles wrap. All merchant operations are on-chain and role-gated.

*First-class Circle entities with dedicated lifecycle, Circle Admin roles with explicit stake requirements, and Circle-scoped merchant grouping are planned for a future release.*

---

## Payment Channels and Country Controls

Policy is governed at the currency/country layer.

- Supported currencies can be activated or deactivated.
- Payment-channel configs are created, updated, activated, and deactivated.
- Monthly volume controls and thresholds are enforced by config.
- Merchant minimum stake and fee percentages are set per currency.

This creates a jurisdiction-aware operating model.

---

## Order Assignment

Order assignment is constrained by merchant and payment-channel checks.

- Online/offline state
- Blacklist, dispute, and unstake-request status
- Ongoing-order capacity checks
- Payment-channel active/approved status
- Daily and monthly volume checks
- Fiat and stake-backed liquidity thresholds

Assignment is deterministic and on-chain. The checks are layered so that a single failing condition removes a merchant from the candidate pool without affecting others.

---

## Disputes

If a dispute is raised, follow these steps.

1. Review order context and timestamps.
2. Submit supporting evidence in-app (including ZK/TLS-backed proofs where available).
3. Follow settlement updates and resulting order state transitions.

Disputes are settled on-chain by authorized admins under protocol fault rules and dispute windows.

```mermaid

    issue --> dispute[DisputeRaised]
    dispute --> evidence[SubmitEvidence]
    evidence --> settle[AdminSettlementOnChain]
    settle --> outcome[FinalOutcome]
```

*Jury-based escalation tiers and governance-vote finality for disputes are planned for a future release.*

---

## Delegation and Revenue Sharing

Token holders stake $P2P on Circles to attest to merchant trustworthiness and earn a share of the Circle's transaction revenue. Revenue is split based on working capital ratio with a merchant premium. Only delegation to $P2P-denominated Circles grants governance voting rights.

*The full delegation UI and Circle-level reward routing mechanics are planned for a future release.*

---

## Insurance

Each Circle includes insurance pools to protect participants.

**CAIP (Circle Admin Insurance Pool).** First-line coverage funded by a percentage of Circle volume plus slashed stakes.

**CALR (Circle Admin Locked Rewards).** A portion of admin earnings locked as a rolling buffer.

**PIP (Protocol Insurance Pool).** Backstop for systemic failures or depleted lower-tier pools.

Claims draw from pools in strict priority order. CAIP first, then CALR, then PIP.

*Circle-native insurance pools with programmable slash/reward logic and claim workflows are planned for a future release.*

## Risk and Reliability Practices

- Respond quickly to assigned orders.
- Keep channel metadata and payment details accurate.
- Avoid operating channels when unavailable.
- Preserve evidence trails for contested payments.
- Treat cancellations and disputes as quality signals to improve operations.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Not getting assigned orders

- Confirm you are online and channels are approved/active.
- Confirm operational availability and liquidity sufficiency.

### Orders frequently cancelled

- Review response speed and settlement completion discipline.
- Ensure payment channel details and balances are current.

### Unable to complete payout or settlement path

- Re-check channel readiness and app prompts.
- Escalate using supported admin/ops process if needed.

### Fee withdrawal not available

- Confirm you have accrued withdrawable fees and no blocking state.
- Retry through supported merchant operations interface.

## FAQ

### Do I need to know internal scoring criteria?

No. Operate based on app-visible status, liquidity requirements, and channel approval states.

### Can I run multiple payment channels?

Yes, each subject to its own approval and volume limits.

### What happens if a user disputes my order?

Submit evidence promptly. The dispute resolves on-chain based on fault determination and the evidence provided.

### Can I pause order assignments?

Yes. Toggle online/offline status or deactivate channels when you can't service orders.

### What is a Circle of Trust and how does it affect me?

A Circle is a community-backed group of merchants. Circle Admins oversee operations, and community members can delegate tokens to your Circle to earn yield. As a merchant, your primary interaction is through the merchant registry and payment channels that Circles wrap.

### How do I earn revenue?

Merchants earn a share of transaction volume through the protocol's fee distribution model. You can withdraw accrued fees through the supported merchant operations flow. See [`/for-investors`](/for-investors) for the full fee distribution breakdown.

### Where are the exact numeric thresholds?

Thresholds visible in your deployment/client are operational. Internal scoring criteria are not publicly documented.

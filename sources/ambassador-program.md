## Cypherpunk 2.0 Manifesto

Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.

We the cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

**"The Liberation Network" exists to:**
- Enable financial sovereignty without surveillance
- Build peer-to-peer systems that resist censorship
- Empower individuals to transact freely across borders
- Spread the tools and knowledge of financial liberation

Participation requires no identity. Contribution requires no permission. Impact is measured by action, not affiliation.

- **Country-led:** Each country manages all tracks locally through "Country Leads"
- **Human selection:** "Country Leads" and "Keymasters" evaluate, not algorithms
- **Internal criteria:** On-chain activity reviewed privately
- **Sustainable ratio:** 1 "Keymaster" per 5 "Ciphers" max
- **Centralized funds:** All payments approved by "Core Team"
- **Track-based SLAs:** Impressions, commits, or onboarding
- **Cypherpunk ethos:** Privacy, decentralization, financial sovereignty

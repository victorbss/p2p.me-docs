## Cypherpunk 2.0 Manifesto

Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.

We the cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

**"The Liberation Network" exists to enable the following.**

- Financial sovereignty without surveillance
- Peer-to-peer systems that resist censorship
- Individuals transacting freely across borders
- Spreading the tools and knowledge of financial liberation

Participation requires no identity. Contribution requires no permission. Impact is measured by action, not affiliation.

## Principles

- **Anonymous-first.** No doxxing required at any level
- **Country-led.** Each country manages all tracks locally
- **Human selection.** "Country Leads" and "Keymasters" evaluate, not algorithms
- **Sustainable ratio.** 1 "Keymaster" per 5 "Ciphers" max
- **Cypherpunk ethos.** Privacy, decentralization, financial sovereignty

## FAQ

### Do I need to reveal my identity to participate?

No. The program is anonymous-first at every level.

### What is XP and how do I earn it?

XP is earned through app usage and social activity. You need 500 XP to be eligible for a "Cipher" role.

### What happens if I miss a weekly update?

One missed update triggers a warning. Two consecutive missed updates result in automatic role removal. You can re-apply through the normal process.

### Can I participate from any country?

You can join Discord from anywhere. Active tracks depend on which countries have appointed Country Leads.

### How are payments made?

All payments go directly to your P2P wallet.

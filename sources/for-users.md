## Understanding Order States

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `PLACED` | Order created and pending active handling |
| `ACCEPTED` | A merchant accepted the order |
| `PAID` | Payment leg was marked paid in protocol flow |
| `COMPLETED` | Settlement path finished successfully |
| `CANCELLED` | Order was cancelled or expired |

If your order remains in a state longer than expected, use in-app support/escalation and check dispute eligibility.

---

## Disputes and Evidence

If the counterparty doesn't fulfill their obligation, take the following steps.

1. Open a dispute within the allowed time window.
2. Submit evidence in-app.
3. Monitor dispute status.

Disputes are resolved on-chain by authorized admins under protocol fault rules. *Jury-based escalation tiers are planned for a future release.*

---

## Troubleshooting

### Order was cancelled unexpectedly

- Check whether the order expired or a transfer step failed.
- Recreate order with correct details and complete steps promptly.

### Merchant not responding

- Wait for the protocol reassignment/timeout path where applicable.
- If conditions are met, raise a dispute with evidence.

### Transfer failed

- Confirm token approval/balance for SELL/PAY.
- Confirm rail details and payment confirmation steps for BUY.

## FAQ

### Do I need to understand on-chain mechanics?

No. The client app handles all contract interaction. Follow status prompts.

### Why wasn't my order matched instantly?

Merchant assignment depends on real-time eligibility factors, including liquidity, channel status, volume limits, and operational availability. If no merchant qualifies, the order waits or times out.

### Can I appeal a dispute?

Use the in-app dispute process. *Governance-driven escalation tiers are planned for a future release.*

### Is my identity stored on-chain?

No raw PII is stored on-chain. The protocol uses ZK-KYC proofs for identity verification and stores only commitments and verdicts on-chain.

### How do I know what to do next?

Your order status (`PLACED`, `ACCEPTED`, `PAID`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`) tells you. Each status implies a specific next action. The app guides you through it.

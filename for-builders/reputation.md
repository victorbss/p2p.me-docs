Reputation Points (RP) control who can do what on the protocol. RP directly governs transaction limits, dispute outcomes, and reward eligibility.

- Volume-driven RP growth rewards consistent participation.
- Dispute losses impose RP penalties that reduce future capacity.
- Verification signals (Aadhaar, social, passport) gate reward claims without requiring raw PII on-chain.

When token governance activates, RP and token voting become complementary. Tokens govern rules and reputation governs access.

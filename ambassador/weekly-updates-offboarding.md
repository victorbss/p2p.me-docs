## Weekly Update Requirement

All "Ciphers" and "Keymasters" must submit weekly updates to maintain active status.

| Role | Reports To | Deadline |
|------|------------|----------|
| "Cipher" | "Keymaster" | Saturday 00:00 – Sunday 24:00 |
| "Keymaster" | "Country Lead" | Saturday 00:00 – Sunday 24:00 |
| "Country Lead" | "Core Team" | Saturday 00:00 – Sunday 24:00 |

**Update Format:**
```
Weekly Update - [Name] - [Week of MM/DD]
- What I did this week:
- Blockers:
- Plan for next week:
```

*All times in UTC. Updates must be submitted between Saturday 00:00 and Sunday 24:00 each week.*

## Auto-Offboarding

Missing updates triggers automatic offboarding:

| Missed Updates | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| 1 consecutive | Warning DM sent automatically |
| 2 consecutive | Role removed, moved to @Alumni |

**Process:**
1. Miss Week 1 update → Bot sends warning DM
2. Miss Week 2 update → Role automatically removed
3. Member moved to @Alumni role (can rejoin through normal process)

**Reinstatement:**
- @Alumni members can re-apply through normal Candidate → Cipher process
- Previous experience noted but no automatic reinstatement

*This applies equally to "Ciphers" and "Keymasters".*

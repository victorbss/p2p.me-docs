## Do I need to reveal my identity to participate?

No. The program is anonymous-first at every level.

## What is XP and how do I earn it?

XP is earned through app usage and social activity. You need 500 XP to be eligible for a "Cipher" role.

## What happens if I miss a weekly update?

One missed update triggers a warning. Two consecutive missed updates result in automatic role removal. You can re-apply through the normal process.

## Can I participate from any country?

You can join Discord from anywhere. Active tracks depend on which countries have appointed Country Leads.

## How are payments made?

All payments go directly to your P2P wallet.

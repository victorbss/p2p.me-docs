Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.

We the cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

**"The Liberation Network" exists to enable the following.**

- Financial sovereignty without surveillance
- Peer-to-peer systems that resist censorship
- Individuals transacting freely across borders
- Spreading the tools and knowledge of financial liberation

Participation requires no identity. Contribution requires no permission. Impact is measured by action, not affiliation.

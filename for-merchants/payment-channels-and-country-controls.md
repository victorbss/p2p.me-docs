Policy is governed at the currency/country layer.

- Supported currencies can be activated or deactivated.
- Payment-channel configs are created, updated, activated, and deactivated.
- Monthly volume controls and thresholds are enforced by config.
- Merchant minimum stake and fee percentages are set per currency.

This creates a jurisdiction-aware operating model.

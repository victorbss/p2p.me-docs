Token holders stake $P2P on Circles to attest to merchant trustworthiness and earn a share of the Circle's transaction revenue. Revenue is split based on working capital ratio with a merchant premium. Only delegation to $P2P-denominated Circles grants governance voting rights.

*The full delegation UI and Circle-level reward routing mechanics are planned for a future release.*

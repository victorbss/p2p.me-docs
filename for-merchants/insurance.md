Each Circle includes insurance pools to protect participants.

**CAIP (Circle Admin Insurance Pool).** First-line coverage funded by a percentage of Circle volume plus slashed stakes.

**CALR (Circle Admin Locked Rewards).** A portion of admin earnings locked as a rolling buffer.

**PIP (Protocol Insurance Pool).** Backstop for systemic failures or depleted lower-tier pools.

Claims draw from pools in strict priority order. CAIP first, then CALR, then PIP.

*Circle-native insurance pools with programmable slash/reward logic and claim workflows are planned for a future release.*

As a merchant, you should routinely perform the following.

- Keep channels active only when you can service them.
- Maintain sufficient liquidity for expected order load.
- Monitor order states and ongoing-order constraints.
- Withdraw accrued fees via supported flow.
- Use unstake/request flows when reducing or exiting activity.

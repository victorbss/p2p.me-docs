## Do I need to know internal scoring criteria?

No. Operate based on app-visible status, liquidity requirements, and channel approval states.

## Can I run multiple payment channels?

Yes, each subject to its own approval and volume limits.

## What happens if a user disputes my order?

Submit evidence promptly. The dispute resolves on-chain based on fault determination and the evidence provided.

## Can I pause order assignments?

Yes. Toggle online/offline status or deactivate channels when you can't service orders.

## What is a Circle of Trust and how does it affect me?

A Circle is a community-backed group of merchants. Circle Admins oversee operations, and community members can delegate tokens to your Circle to earn yield. As a merchant, your primary interaction is through the merchant registry and payment channels that Circles wrap.

## How do I earn revenue?

Merchants earn a share of transaction volume through the protocol's fee distribution model. You can withdraw accrued fees through the supported merchant operations flow. See [`/for-investors`](/for-investors/start-here) for the full fee distribution breakdown.

## Where are the exact numeric thresholds?

Thresholds visible in your deployment/client are operational. Internal scoring criteria are not publicly documented.

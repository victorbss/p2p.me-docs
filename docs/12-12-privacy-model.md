- **Data minimization:** contracts store only commitments, verdicts, and reputation deltas.
- **Selective disclosure:** ZK/TLS proofs reveal only predicates required for settlement or compliance tiers.

- **Linkability:** user-facing guidance to avoid unintended linkage across sessions where feasible.

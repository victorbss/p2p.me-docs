- **Data minimization:** contracts store only commitments, verdicts, and reputation deltas.
- **Selective disclosure:** ZK-KYC proofs reveal only predicates required for identity verification and compliance tiers. A planned evidence module will extend selective disclosure to bank transaction verification for settlement.
- **Retention & Access:** governance-set retention of attestations; no raw PII on-chain.
- **Linkability:** user-facing guidance to avoid unintended linkage across sessions where feasible.

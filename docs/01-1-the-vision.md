## 1.1 From "ramps" to a privacy and credibility based economy

P2P Protocol starts with the most practical chokepoint—moving between fiat and stablecoins—without custodial escrow. The same rails, proofs, and incentives that make an honest ramp work at scale also enable the next layer: credibility-based liquidity, bridging the gap between fiat and crypto currencies, for all DeFi.

In this model:

- **Reputation** is earned on-chain through completed trades, clean dispute histories, and ZK-KYC tiers—not through centralized account vetting.
- **Privacy** is preserved by default via zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification, revealing only that a user is verified and permitted—without exposing raw identities.
- **Usefulness** beats theory: micro-payments, everyday off-ramps, wages, remittances, and merchant payouts come first—designed to feel as simple as sending a message.

## 1.2 What "good" looks like by 2026+

- A user in any supported country can buy or sell stablecoins in ~minutes—targeting sub-90-second completion on fast rails—without giving custody to anyone.
- Merchants are matched based on reliability and Proof-of-Credibility scores, with spread set at the protocol level rather than through merchant competition.
- ZK-KYC unlocks higher limits and faster paths while keeping personal data off-chain. A planned evidence module for bank transaction verification will further extend privacy-preserving proofs to dispute resolution.
- Third-party apps and wallets integrate the protocol through open SDKs; Coins.me is only a reference consumer front-end, not a privileged gateway.
- As credibility compounds, new products (installment payouts, escrowless commerce, cross-border salaries, dispute insurance) can be built without re-KYCing the world.

## 1.3 First principles

1. **Non-custodial by construction.** No fiat escrow. Crypto only held atomically for settlement where necessary.
2. **Privacy-preserving.** Prove what's needed; reveal nothing else.
3. **Credible neutrality.** Open rules, upgradeable by governance; no special routes for any client.
4. **Useful and simple.** The experience should feel like one tap to "Buy USDC" or "Cash out," with the protocol handling the invisible complexity.
5. **Protocol-agnostic.** The design does not hinge on any single L2, oracle, or proof vendor. Implementations can change without rewriting the whitepaper.

## 1.4 What P2P Protocol is (and is not)

**Is:** an open, decentralized coordination layer that trustlessly matches a buyer with a highly vetted merchant according to a transparent reputation system; settles trades with on-chain coordination; and routes fees and parameters through governance.

**Is not:** a custodian, a bank, or a data broker. P2P Protocol does not custody fiat, does not warehouse users' personal information, and does not promise fixed yields.

## 1.5 Why this matters now

Over the past decade, crypto solved programmatic finance but left the real world at the door. Today three curves finally cross:

- Instant local rails (UPI/PIX/QRIS & peers) are mainstream.
- Practical ZK can attest to real-world facts without exposing the data—already used for identity verification, with bank transaction proofs on the roadmap.
- L2s and stablecoins have made small payments cheap and fast enough to care about.

P2P Protocol sits exactly at that intersection. It turns *trust me* into *prove it*, and it does so without handing anyone your money or your identity.

## 1.6 North-star outcomes (what "good" looks like to us)

By 2026+:

- Sub-90-second settlement on fast rails, median cost under $0.20 per $100.
- \>99% disputes resolved by proofs within the window, not by moderators.
- Portable credibility: your reputation and limits travel with you across clients and countries—without doxxing you.
- Neutral access: multiple wallets and apps, including Coins.me as a reference, all using the same permissionless SDKs atop the Protocol.
- Everyday usefulness: wages, remittances, marketplace payouts, and checkout—no custody, no paper KYC forms, no screenshots.

## 1.7 Credibility-based DeFi (beyond over-collateralization)

Over-collateralization made early DeFi safe, but it makes the everyday world feel gated and expensive. P2P Protocol proposes a second pillar: **credibility**.

- Earned limits and better prices come from clean history, completed trades, and ZK-KYC tiers, not from locking 200% collateral or gaming the system.
- Privacy by default: you reveal proofs of action, not identities.
- Composability: the same credibility graph supports installment payouts, escrowless commerce, and even lightweight credit primitives in the future.

## 1.8 A protocol for people, not just power users

We design for someone who has a phone and a paycheck, not a Bloomberg terminal.

- **Micro-friendly:** The Protocol must feel safe at $15 as much as at $1,500.
- **Dignity with Privacy:** ZK-KYC verifications prove what's necessary and nothing more, no Personal Identification revelation—protecting freelance workers, activists, and anyone who values privacy.

## 1.9 Protocol-agnostic by design

Vendors and chains will change; the principles cannot. The whitepaper commits to:

- No single L2, oracle, or proof provider baked into the logic.
- Clear interfaces (verifier registry, oracle adapter, rail registry) so parts can be swapped without rewriting the paper or the social contract.
- Open Sourcing and Decentralizing each part of the Protocol as public goods.

## 1.10 Credibility but with Privacy

Think of P2P Protocol's Proof-of-Credibility as a public good in itself:

- It's earned, decays over time, and is hard to game.
- It is portable across clients and countries via on-chain commitments, not PDFs in someone's inbox.
- It's privacy-first: only commitments and verdicts are public; raw evidence stays with you or your chosen verifier.

## 1.11 Programmable compliance (policy without dossiers)

Most people want two things at once: privacy and legality. P2P Protocol makes this practical:

- **Policy-as-parameters:** rails, timeouts, and proof requirements are governed on-chain by region and risk class.
- **ZK-KYC tiers** satisfy "permitted user" checks while keeping PII off-chain.
- **Travel-Rule-style needs** can be met via selective disclosure circuits (planned) when a counterparty is a registered business—without turning the protocol into a data broker.

## 1.12 What gets unlocked if we get this right

- **Borderless income:** creators, contractors, and remote workers get paid where they live, without exchange custody.
- **Merchant payouts:** marketplaces settle to sellers in local rails instantaneously, at fair spreads, with no CSV juggling.
- **Community finance:** rotating savings, micro-loans, and escrowless marketplaces can build on a shared credibility and liquidity layer between the fiat and crypto currency domains.
- **Civic resilience:** people can move value privately and lawfully when the world gets shaky.

## 1.13 Stewardship & governance philosophy

- Credible neutrality over convenience. Changes go through transparent governance with guardrails (timelocks, narrow pauses, audits).
- Minimize governance where possible: parametrize, don't micromanage.
- Public safety valves: oracle circuit breakers, verifier sunsets, and emergency pauses with automatic expiry.
- Open bounty mindset: pay to find flaws early; publish fixes openly.

## 1.14 What we won't compromise on

- Non-custody of fiat (ever).
- No honeypots of PII (Personal Identifiable Information) on-chain (ever).
- No privileged clients (ever). Everyone uses the same pipes.
- No "trust us" black boxes. If it can't be proven or audited, it doesn't make core.

## 1.15 Milestones that matter 

- **Ubiquity:** a credible merchant presence in every major region/rail pair.
- **Geographic reach:** expansion to 20+ markets across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and MENA.
- **Multi-chain presence:** support for additional networks including Solana and emerging high-performance chains.
- **Composability:** third-party apps shipping useful features on the SDK without asking permission.
- **Self-serve legitimacy:** regulators and risk teams can read the spec, verify parameters on-chain, and understand how safety is achieved—without backdoors.
- **Roadmap features:** for current feature-track proposals (including remittance and currency expansion), see [`/for-builders`](/for-builders/start-here).

## 1.16 A short manifesto

> Privacy is a user interface problem as much as a math problem.

> Reputation should be earned, portable, and revoke-able—never sold.

> The best KYC is the one that proves what's needed and nothing else.

> If only power users can use it, it isn't DeFi—it's a gated club.

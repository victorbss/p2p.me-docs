## 10.1 Current Liquidity Model

The stablecoin liquidity is currently offered by carefully reviewed peers from all around the globe, following the Proof-of-Credibility algorithm. Liquidity is available around the clock with affordable fees, secure transactions, and ease of use.

## 10.2 Future Liquidity Enhancements

Future versions may introduce merchant staking or LP incentives using protocol tokens. Specifically, the most frequent and reputed users of the protocol would be able to stake their stablecoin holdings for reward in the form of protocol tokens. This new liquidity would exist on top of the existing liquidity offered by the merchants.

Quote commitment, minimum depth, and cancellation penalties are governed to reduce adverse selection and no-shows.

# **9\. Security Model (TECH TODO)**

## **9.1 Assumptions & Adversaries**

* Network liveness on Base; oracle availability; honest-majority assumptions **not** required for fiat rails.  
* Adversaries include chargeback fraudsters, proof forgers, oracle manipulators, griefers, and sybils.

## **9.2 Mitigations**

* Bonds/slashing; rail-class windows; proof verification requirements; oracle deviation guards; rate/limit throttles.  
* **Audits & Bounty:** Core contracts, verifiers, and circuits will undergo independent audits; a public bounty program will operate pre- and post-TGE.

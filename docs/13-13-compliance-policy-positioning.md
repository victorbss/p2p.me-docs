## 13. Compliance & Policy Positioning

> *LEGAL TODO*

Unsurprisingly, while P2P Protocol leads the P2P market with its decentralized model and seamless UI client software, it aims to remain in good standing with legal regulations. The user is responsible for legitimate usage and taxation in their jurisdiction.

- **Non-custodial stance:** The Protocol coordinates peers and verifies evidence; it does not take custody of fiat.
- **Risk controls:** transaction limits, reputation tiers, optional ZK-KYC, sanctions-screening interfaces for merchants, and governed regional parameter sets.
- **Disclosures:** The Protocol does not advocate tax evasion or illegal activity; violations remain the user's liability.

### 13.1 User Responsibility in Taxation

The Protocol aims to remain in completely good standing with legal regulations surrounding the use of the platform. To this end, the user is ultimately responsible for legitimate usage of the exchange and is solely responsible for taxation compliance. In short, the Protocol does not levy taxes on a user's behalf, but the user is responsible for filing (or withholding) them all the same, subject to the jurisdiction they reside in.

Likewise, it must be noted that the Protocol in no way intends to advocate tax evasion or related practices. As a trustless KYC solution for both on-ramp and off-ramp transactions, the Protocol merely attempts to preserve the privacy and anonymity of the user for fair transactions. In the event any illegal activity including but not limited to tax evasion occurs, the user shall be fully liable for the legal consequences within their jurisdiction.

### 13.2 Micro-Transactions for Mass Adoption

Blockchain transactions have been traditionally notorious for high transfer fees and slow processing times. However, based on Base, the Protocol can afford to charge very nominal fees for its on- and off-ramps, thanks to the faster validation times and lower gas costs. The difference is especially pronounced for smaller transactions where newcomers routinely feel discouraged by the slow and expensive economics involved.

Fortunately, the Protocol's robust on-chain reputation management coupled with its transaction limits does more than just drive mass adoption of decentralized currencies and transactions. In fact, a sole emphasis on large transactions ironically coincides with the prospects of money laundering and other foul economic practices. P2P Protocol in the space particularly underscores the importance of micro-transactions instead, by making these both viable and useful for the community.

Besides mass consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies, microtransactions enable newfound financial access through web3 for underrepresented communities in today's banking system. Specifically, it has been noted that nearly **1.2 billion people have mobile phones but lack any reliable access to banks**. For them, being able to perform transactions in the neighborhood of $50-$500 in a way that is secure and egalitarian is paramount—a feat that P2P Protocol can readily help achieve.

Indeed, the adoption of crypto for consumer payments has implications for both the Web2 and Web3 economies. Existing consumer tech companies can finally start accepting payments online using cryptocurrency. Likewise, the market can explore newly enabled ways of spending and deploying capital, thanks to a microtransaction economy powering fully decentralized finance.

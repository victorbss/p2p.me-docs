# 10. Privacy Model ( DECENTRALIZATION TODO)

* **Data minimization:** contracts store only commitments, verdicts, and reputation deltas.  
* **Selective disclosure:** ZK/TLS proofs reveal only predicates required for settlement or compliance tiers.  
* **Retention & Access:** governance-set retention of attestations; no raw PII on-chain.  
* **Linkability:** user-facing guidance to avoid unintended linkage across sessions where feasible.

Traditional DeFi often reaches for heavy collateral to feel safe. That works for some instruments, but it makes everyday finance clunky and exclusionary. Credibility-based DeFi says: let peers earn limits, speed, and price by behaving well over time, with ZK-KYC protecting identity privacy along the way.

This strikes a better balance: useful for real people, privacy-preserving for those who need it most, and resilient because reputation is distributed and portable—not trapped in a single platform's database.

# **12\. Accessing [P2P.me](http://P2P.me): Clients & SDKs**

## **12.1 Clients and Ease of Use**

Blockchain transactions have been traditionally notorious for high transfer fees and slow processing times. However, based on Base, [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) can afford to charge very nominal fees for its on- and off-ramps, thanks to the faster validation times and the cheaper MATIC working behind the scenes. The difference is especially pronounced for smaller transactions where newcomers routinely feel discouraged by the slow and expensive economics involved.

Fortunately, [P2P.me](http://P2P.me)’s robust on-chain reputation management coupled with its transaction limits does more than just drive mass adoption of decentralized currencies and transactions. In fact, a sole emphasis on large transactions ironically coincides with the prospects of money laundering and other foul economic practices. [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) in the space particularly underscores the importance of micro-transactions instead, by making these both viable and useful for the community.

Besides mass consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies, microtransactions enable newfound financial access through web3 for underrepresented communities in today's banking system. Specifically, it has been noted that nearly 1.2 billion people have mobile phones but lack any reliable access to banks. For them, being able to perform transactions in the neighborhood of $50-$500 in a way that is secure and egalitarian is paramount– a feat that the [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) protocol can readily help achieve.

Indeed, the adoption of crypto for consumer payments has implications for both the Web2 and Web3 economies. Existing consumer tech companies can finally start accepting payments online using cryptocurrency. Likewise, the market can explore newly enabled ways of spending and deploying capital, thanks to a microtransaction economy powering fully decentralized finance.

The most famous and easiest way to access the [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) protocol is to use the [**P2P.me**](http://P2P.me) **mobile app**. Getting started with on-ramps is as simple as buying stablecoins via a fiat transfer; off-ramps are just as reliable through a stablecoin deposit. Any entity can create and distribute a functional UI client for [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) to conduct fully decentralized on/off-ramp transactions.

## **12.2 Client-Side SDKs (B2B Integration)**

The [**P2P.me**](http://P2P.me) **SDK** in development currently, will let developers integrate the P2P protocol and on/off-ramp users directly into their platforms, enabling consumer micropayments in crypto, embedded within their own DApps.

## **12.3 [Coins.me](http://Coins.me) (Consumer App)**

[**Coins.me**](http://Coins.me) is presented as a **consumer product layer built on top of the protocol**—a reference front-end that demonstrates best practices, not a privileged gateway. Fees, routing, and features remain protocol-governed to encourage a healthy multi-client ecosystem.

# 13. Governance & Upgradability 

ALL THINGS BELOW TODO FOR GOVERNANCE/DECENTRALIZATION TEAM

* **Parameters:** fees, limits, rail risk weights, oracle sets, proof policies, bond schedules.  
* **Upgrades:** contracts behind timelocks with public proposals; emergency pause limited to narrow scopes, with automatic sunset.  
* **Pre-TGE:** multisig/council with published members and constraints.  
* **Post-TGE:** token-holder governance of parameters, treasury, and roadmap.

# 4. Trade Protocol (On- and Off-Ramp)

We formalize the order lifecycle as a **state machine** with timeouts:

**States:** `OPEN → MATCHED → FUNDED → PROOF_SUBMITTED? → SETTLED | DISPUTED → RESOLVED | EXPIRED`

**Common Parameters (governed):**

* `T_match` (max time to accept a match), `T_fiat` (max time to make fiat transfer), `T_proof` (proof submission window), `T_dispute` (challenge window).  
* `B_bond_user`, `B_bond_merchant` (optional performance bonds/slashing weights by reputation tier and payment rail risk class).  
* `min_amount`, `max_amount` per rail/region; fee schedules; quote expiry windows.

## 4.1 On-Ramp (Fiat → USDC on Base)

1. **Open:** User opens BUY order with amount & rail.  
2. **Match:** Protocol assigns a merchant (highest compatible **Proof-of-Credibility** and quote). Refundable bonds may lock.  
3. **Fund Fiat:** User pays fiat to provided account within `T_fiat`.  
4. **Merchant Ack / Proof:** Merchant confirms receipt; if delayed, user may present a TLS-backed payment proof.  
5. **Settle:** Contract releases USDC to user; fees assessed; bonds unlocked.  
6. **Dispute:** If conflict, parties submit proofs; resolver issues on-chain verdict.

## 4.2 Off-Ramp (USDC on Base → Fiat)

1. **Open:** User opens SELL order; transfers USDC to escrowless settlement adapter (contract holds or streams atomically per design).  
2. **Match:** Merchant accepts and posts quote/bond.  
3. **Fund Crypto:** User’s USDC is locked for settlement.  
4. **Merchant Pays Fiat:** Merchant pays fiat; submits proof; or user challenges.  
5. **Settle/Dispute:** As above.

## 4.3 Payment-Rail Risk Classes

Rails differ (instant/irreversible vs reversible/chargeback-prone). The protocol maps rails to **required proof strength**, bond multipliers, and longer/shorter windows.

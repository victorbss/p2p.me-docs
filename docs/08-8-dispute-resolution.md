## 8. Dispute Resolution

Every instance of data sharing within the Protocol takes place via ZK principled evidence. If a user files a dispute within the DApp over the Protocol, the other party can issue and share a proof of their transaction without submitting additional personal data. A smart contract settles the dispute automatically when verifiers attest that the required statement has been proven; otherwise bonds and fees route per policy.

**Windows & Burdens:** Default onus: the party claiming completion provides the completion proof. The challenger can present a counter-proof (e.g., bank statement show-non-receipt). Fail-to-prove paths trigger slashing or refunds according to the Protocol rules.

**Penalty for False Claims:** In the event a buyer attempts to proceed without actually making the fiat transfer first, they risk losing Reputation Points (e.g., 50 RP)—creating strong economic disincentives for fraudulent behavior.

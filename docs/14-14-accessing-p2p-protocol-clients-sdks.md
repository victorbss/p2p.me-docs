## 14. Accessing P2P Protocol: Clients & SDKs

### 14.1 Clients and Ease of Use

The primary clients for accessing P2P Protocol are the p2p.me and coins.me Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). These browser-based applications provide seamless access across devices, letting users import or export their wallet address for Base USDC (and any other chains supported in the future).

Getting started with on-ramps is as simple as buying stablecoins via a fiat transfer; off-ramps are just as reliable through a stablecoin deposit to a trusted in-app wallet.

Of course, these PWAs are not the only way to access P2P Protocol. Any entity can create and distribute a functional UI client for the Protocol to conduct fully decentralized on/off-ramp transactions.

### 14.2 Client-Side SDKs (B2B Integration)

The P2P Protocol SDK lets developers integrate the protocol to on/off-ramp users directly into their platform. Essentially, the SDKs enable the B2B layer for prospective Web2/Web3 apps and websites to access and integrate P2P Protocol directly into their service, thus enabling consumer micropayments in crypto among other possible use cases.

### 14.3 Coins.me (Consumer App)

Coins.me is one of the two primary PWAs for accessing P2P Protocol, alongside p2p.me. As a consumer-focused application, it provides a streamlined interface for everyday users. Fees, routing, and features remain protocol-governed to encourage a healthy multi-client ecosystem.

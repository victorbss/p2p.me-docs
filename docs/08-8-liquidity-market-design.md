# **8\. Liquidity & Market Design**

The stablecoin liquidity is currently offered by carefully reviewed peers from all around the globe, following the **Proof-of-Credibility** algorithm. Liquidity is available around the clock with affordable fees, secure transactions, and ease of use.

Future versions may introduce **merchant staking** or **LP incentives** using protocol tokens. Quote commitment, minimum depth, and cancellation penalties are governed to reduce adverse selection and no-shows.

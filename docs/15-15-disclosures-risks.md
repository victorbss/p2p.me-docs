# **15\. Disclosures & Risks**

* **Regulatory change risk:** jurisdictional shifts may limit features or coverage.  
* **Liquidity risk:** thin books can widen spreads and delay matches.  
* **Oracle risk:** data outages or manipulation; mitigated by deviation guards and fail-safes.  
* **Payment rail risk:** reversals/chargebacks on certain rails; managed via risk classes, bonds, and windows.  
* **Smart-contract risk:** despite audits and bounties, residual risk remains.

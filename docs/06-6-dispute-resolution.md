# **6\. Dispute Resolution**

Every instance of data sharing at [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) takes place via ZK principled evidence. If a user files a dispute within the DApp over the Protocol, the other party can issue and share a proof of their transaction without submitting additional personal data. A smart contract settles the dispute automatically when verifiers attest that the required statement has been proven; otherwise bonds and fees route per policy.

**Windows & Burdens:** Default onus: *the party claiming completion provides the completion proof*. The challenger can present a counter-proof (e.g., bank statement show-non-receipt). Fail-to-prove paths trigger slashing or refunds according to the Protocol rules..

# **11\. Compliance & Policy Positioning (LEGAL TODO)**

Unsurprisingly, while [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) leads the P2P market with its decentralized model and seamless UI client software, it aims to remain in good standing with legal regulations. The user is responsible for legitimate usage and taxation in their jurisdiction.

**Non-custodial stance:** [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) coordinates peers and verifies evidence; it does not take custody of fiat.

**Risk controls:** transaction limits, reputation tiers, optional ZK-KYC, sanctions-screening interfaces for merchants, and governed regional parameter sets.

**Disclosures:** [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) does not advocate tax evasion or illegal activity; violations remain the user’s liability.

[P2P.me](http://P2P.me) aims to remain in completely good standing with legal regulations surrounding the use of the platform. To this end, the user is ultimately responsible for legitimate usage of the exchange and is solely responsible for taxation compliance. In short, [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) does not levy taxes on a user’s behalf, but the user is responsible for filing (or withholding) them all the same, subject to the jurisdiction they reside in.

Likewise, it must be noted that [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) in no way intends to advocate tax evasion or related practices. As a trustless KYC solution for both on-ramp and off-ramp transactions, [P2P.me](http://P2P.me) merely attempts to preserve the privacy and anonymity of the user for fair transactions. In the event any illegal activity including but not limited to tax evasion occurs, the user shall be fully liable for the legal consequences within their jurisdiction.

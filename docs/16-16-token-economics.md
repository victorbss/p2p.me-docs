## 16. Token Economics

The protocol token serves two primary purposes: governance and economic utility.

As a governance token, holders participate in decisions that shape the protocol's evolution. This includes voting on parameter adjustments such as fee structures, transaction limits, and risk weights. Token holders also vote on protocol upgrades, oracle set configurations, and treasury allocations. The goal is to decentralize decision-making while maintaining the protocol's integrity and safety.

The token also provides economic utility within the ecosystem. Merchants and verifiers may stake tokens as bonds, aligning their incentives with honest behavior. Fee routing mechanisms can offer rebates or discounts to active participants. The token enables participation in dispute insurance pools that protect users from edge-case losses. Growth incentives distributed in tokens encourage ecosystem expansion and liquidity provision.

A portion of protocol fees flows into a treasury governed on-chain. These funds support ongoing security audits, bug bounty programs, ecosystem grants, and liquidity initiatives. This self-sustaining model ensures the protocol can maintain and improve its infrastructure without relying on external funding.

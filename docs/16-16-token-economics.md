The protocol token is an ownership token. Holders control protocol financials, make governance decisions, and hold enforceable claim over protocol intellectual property.

On the governance side, holders vote on fee structures, transaction limits, risk weights, oracle configurations, treasury allocation, and protocol upgrades. Revenue direction, parameter changes, and IP stewardship belong to the token holder base rather than a centralized team.

On the economic side, merchants and verifiers stake tokens as bonds, aligning their incentives with honest behavior. Fee routing provides rebates and discounts to active participants. The token enables participation in dispute insurance pools and community delegation for revenue sharing.

A portion of protocol fees flows into a treasury governed on-chain. These funds support security audits, bug bounties, ecosystem grants, and liquidity. If protocol resources were ever misappropriated, token governance provides the mechanism for holders to redirect control.

# 5. Proof-of-Credibility (Reputation & Matching)

[P2P.me](http://P2P.me) works using a unique on-chain reputation system which not only builds up user trust and privileges but actively helps prevent fraudulent activity.

## 5.1 Inputs (illustrative, governed)

* Successful trades (size-weighted), age/decay, dispute history.  
* KYC proof tier (ZK-KYC completed, source diversity).  
* Rail diversity & geography; referral attestations.  
* Slashed events (negative deltas), appeals outcomes.

## 5.2 Outputs

* **Order limits** (min/max), **fee tiers**, **bond multipliers**, **matching priority**.  
* **Regional caps** by compliance policy.

## 5.3 Sybil & Gaming Resistance

* Weighted decay, diminishing returns, rail-mix requirements, and anti-gaming and fraud detection engine checks.  
* Optional attested device/account fingerprints (privacy-respecting commitments).

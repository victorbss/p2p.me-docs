The $P2P token is an **ownership token**. Protocol IP, treasury funds, and mint authority are all controlled by token holders through futarchy-based governance—not by any single team, foundation, or entity. This makes $P2P real, unruggable ownership of revenue-generating infrastructure.

The token enables community-driven protocol management, economic participation through staking and delegation, and value accrual through treasury contributions funded by protocol revenue. Via MetaDAO futarchy governance, token holders direct treasury funds toward buy-and-burn or other value-accruing actions.

The $P2P token launches through a MetaDAO-style sale mechanism designed for fair, community-first distribution.

## How It Works

1. Users commit USDC during a 4-day commitment window
2. Founders set a discretionary cap on total raise accepted
3. If oversubscribed, allocations and refunds are distributed pro-rata
4. 10M tokens are distributed proportionally among all participants at launch
5. Post-sale, the treasury provides 20% of raised USDC and 2.9M tokens to liquidity pools
6. Mint authority transfers to the market-governed treasury

## XP-Based Priority

Existing protocol users with XP receive allocations and priority access. Users who have actively used the protocol through trades, referrals, and community participation are rewarded with preferential positioning in the sale.

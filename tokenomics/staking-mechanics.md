## Circle Admin Staking

Circle Admins stake $P2P tokens (minimum $250 equivalent) to operate merchant networks within Circles of Trust. Admins earn approximately 0.27% of their Circle's volume (8.89% of protocol revenue). One-third of admin rewards are locked for 30 days as an insurance buffer (CALR). Unstaking requires a 30-day cooldown.

## Merchant Staking

Merchants stake USDC ($250-$1,000) to join Circles. They earn a share of approximately 1.6% of transaction volume (53.33% of revenue), distributed based on their working capital ratio. Unstaking requires a 30-day cooldown.

## Community Delegation

Token holders can delegate $P2P to Circles of Trust to earn a share of the circle's revenue pool. Revenue is split based on the working capital ratio, with a merchant premium for operational work. Delegation requires a 15-day cooldown to withdraw and is capped at 4x the total circle stake.

Only delegation to $P2P-denominated Circles grants governance voting rights.

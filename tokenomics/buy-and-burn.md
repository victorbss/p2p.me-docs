Protocol revenue directly reduces token supply through an automated buy-and-burn mechanism:

- 20% of protocol revenue is allocated to buy-and-burn (increasing to 33% via governance by 2027)
- Tokens are purchased on the open market via DEX
- Purchased tokens are sent to the zero address (permanently burned)
- The process is automated via smart contract
- First burn expected Q2 2026 (approximately 3 months post-TGE)

Every transaction the protocol processes makes the supply smaller.

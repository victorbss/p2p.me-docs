20% of protocol revenue is contributed back to the on-chain treasury, planned to increase to 35% as the protocol matures—subject to MetaDAO futarchy governance. This creates a direct link between protocol usage and token economics.

- 20% of protocol revenue flows to the treasury (planned increase to 35% via MetaDAO futarchy governance)
- Via MetaDAO futarchy governance, token holders decide how treasury funds are deployed—including buy-and-burn, ecosystem grants, liquidity incentives, or other value-accruing actions
- Buy-and-burn is one governance-approved mechanism: tokens purchased on the open market via DEX and sent to the zero address (permanently burned)
- First treasury allocation expected Q2 2026 (approximately 3 months post-TGE)

Every transaction the protocol processes makes the supply smaller.

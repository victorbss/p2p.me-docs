## Team Tokens (30% / 7.74M)

Team tokens follow the MetaDAO performance package model. Rather than time-based vesting, tokens unlock based on protocol performance milestones:

- 5 equal tranches of 1,548,000 tokens each
- Tranche 1 unlocks at 2x ICO price
- Tranche 2 unlocks at 4x ICO price
- Tranche 3 unlocks at 8x ICO price
- Tranche 4 unlocks at 16x ICO price
- Tranche 5 unlocks at 32x ICO price
- Minimum unlock time: 18 months from launch per tranche
- Price measured via 3-month TWAP

This aligns team incentives directly with protocol success. The team only benefits when the protocol grows.

## Investor Tokens (20% / 5.16M)

Investor tokens follow a cliff-and-quarterly schedule:

- Month 0-12: Fully locked (cliff)
- Month 12: 1,032,000 tokens unlock (20%)
- Month 15: 1,032,000 tokens unlock (Q1 post-cliff)
- Month 18: 1,032,000 tokens unlock (Q2 post-cliff)
- Month 21: 1,032,000 tokens unlock (Q3 post-cliff)
- Month 24: 1,032,000 tokens unlock (Q4 post-cliff) — fully vested

All vesting is enforced on-chain with no admin override to accelerate. Locked tokens cannot be staked.

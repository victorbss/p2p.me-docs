The protocol follows a three-phase path to full decentralization:

## Phase 1 (Month 0-6 post-TGE)

Foundation multisig controls upgrades. Community provides feedback via forums. Foundation retains emergency pause capability.

## Phase 2 (Month 6-18 post-TGE)

Token-holder voting activates for non-critical parameters. Foundation retains emergency pause. Community can submit governance proposals.

## Phase 3 (Month 18+ post-TGE)

Full DAO control. Foundation reduced to administrative and compliance role. All protocol parameters governed by token holders. Foundation veto authority sunsets permanently.

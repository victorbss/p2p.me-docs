The protocol includes multiple safeguards against admin collusion:

- Admin revenue is partially locked via CALR. Fraudulent claim approvals are caught before locked rewards can be withdrawn.
- Claims above a set threshold require review by a second Circle Admin from a different Circle.
- On-chain metrics (claim approval rate, claims per merchant) are tracked. Threshold violations trigger eligibility for community-initiated audits.

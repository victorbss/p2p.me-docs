## Merchant Rewards

Merchants receive a percentage of their total transaction volume (configurable per country by the Protocol Admin). Revenue distribution is weighted by working capital ratio.

## Circle Admin Rewards

Circle Admins earn a smaller share of the aggregate merchant volume within their circle. A portion of admin rewards is locked for a configurable duration (default: one-third locked for 30 days). These locked rewards (CALR) serve as an insurance buffer and may be used to settle claims if the Circle's primary insurance pool is exhausted.

## Community Delegation

Token holders can delegate $P2P to Circles of Trust to earn a share of the circle's revenue pool. Revenue is split based on working capital ratio with a merchant premium. Only delegation to $P2P-denominated Circles grants governance voting rights.

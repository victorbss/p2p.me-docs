The original merchant model was centralised, permissioned, and trust-based, creating scalability limits, operational inefficiencies, and admin risk. Circles of Trust transform this into a community-led, permissionless, and trustless framework.

## Problems Circles Solve

**Centralised management.** Merchant recruitment, onboarding, guidance, and dispute handling were managed by internal admins, creating operational overhead and limiting scalability.

**Permissioned structure.** The protocol team decided who could manage merchants, making participation closed and permissioned.

**Limited community participation.** Users could only act as buyers and sellers, without roles to contribute or earn beyond trading.

**Off-chain claim settlements.** Many settlements occurred in fiat, outside the protocol, exposing both merchants and protocol to risk and inconsistency.

**High admin risk.** The admin role carried excessive power, creating possibilities for collusion with merchants, biased dispute resolutions, delayed claim settlements, and arbitrary blacklisting.

## What Circles Enable

- **Scale** through formalised, independent Circle Admin roles
- **Decentralisation** by distributing operations across multiple circles
- **Permissionless participation** open to anyone who stakes tokens
- **Community engagement** through staking, delegation, and governance
- **On-chain claim settlements** under protocol-defined rules
- **Trustless stake delegation** with full on-chain visibility
- **Reduced admin risk** with smart contract enforcement replacing discretionary control

A Circle of Trust (CoT) is a community-backed collective of merchants operated by a Circle Admin. Each Circle functions as a semi-autonomous unit within the protocol, managing its own merchant network while adhering to shared on-chain protocol rules.

Circles are the operational backbone of P2P Protocol. They organize merchants into accountable groups, enable community oversight through staking and delegation, and distribute risk through tiered insurance pools.

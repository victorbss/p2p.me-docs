## Team Tokens (30% / 7.74M)

Team tokens follow the MetaDAO performance package model. Rather than time-based vesting, tokens unlock based on protocol performance milestones.

- 5 equal tranches of 1,548,000 tokens each
- Tranches unlock at 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x ICO price
- Minimum unlock time is 18 months from launch per tranche
- Price measured via 3-month TWAP

The team only benefits when the protocol grows.

## Investor Tokens (20% / 5.16M)

- Months 0 through 12 are fully locked (cliff)
- At month 12, 1,032,000 tokens unlock (20%)
- At months 15, 18, 21, and 24, 1,032,000 tokens unlock each quarter
- Fully vested at month 24

Vesting is enforced via on-chain vesting contracts. Locked tokens cannot be staked.

P2P on/off ramping is critical infrastructure for emerging markets. Millions of people depend on it to move between fiat and stablecoins every day. Infrastructure this important cannot remain under the control of a single operator. The token exists to decentralize ownership of this utility so that no single team, company, or jurisdiction can shut it down, censor it, or extract from it unfairly.

`$P2P` is an ownership token. Holders control protocol financials, govern operational parameters, direct treasury spending, and hold enforceable claim over protocol IP. If protocol resources or IP were ever misappropriated, token governance gives holders the mechanism to redirect control. This follows the same ownership-token model used by projects with futarchy and market-governed treasuries, applied to real, revenue-generating infrastructure.

The token enables four things.

- **Decentralized governance.** Holders vote on fees, limits, merchant rules, and treasury allocation. No single operator controls these decisions.
- **Trust staking ("Circles of Trust").** Token holders stake $P2P on merchant liquidity pools to attest to their trustworthiness, earning stablecoin yield from the Circle's transaction revenue.
- **Revenue-linked ownership.** Protocol revenue funds buybacks and burns, directly connecting token value to network usage and growth.
- **Censorship resistance.** Decentralized ownership means no single point of failure. The protocol can survive regulatory pressure in any one jurisdiction because control is distributed globally among token holders.

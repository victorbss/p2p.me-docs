- **Circle Admins** stake $P2P to operate merchant networks. Their stake is slashable, and a portion of their rewards is locked as an insurance buffer.
- **Merchants** stake USDC as working capital for order fulfillment. Their capacity is bounded by their stake.
- **Delegators** stake $P2P to Circles to earn a share of revenue. Only delegation to $P2P-denominated Circles grants governance voting rights.

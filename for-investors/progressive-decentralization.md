Decentralization is phased because governance quality matters more than governance speed.

**Phase 1 (months 0-6 post-TGE).** Foundation multisig controls upgrades. Emergency pause capability exists.

**Phase 2 (months 6-18 post-TGE).** Token-holder voting activates for non-critical parameters. Community can submit governance proposals.

**Phase 3 (month 18+ post-TGE).** Full DAO control. Foundation veto authority sunsets permanently. All protocol parameters governed by token holders.

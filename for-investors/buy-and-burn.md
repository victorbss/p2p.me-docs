Buy-and-burn ties token supply reduction directly to protocol usage.

- 20% of protocol revenue allocated to buy-and-burn (increasing to 33% via governance by 2027)
- Tokens purchased on open market via DEX and sent to zero address
- First burn expected Q2 2026 (~3 months post-TGE)

The mechanism is deliberately simple. Revenue comes in, and tokens are burned. The burn rate scales with volume, creating a direct link between product traction and supply pressure.

## Why does P2P need a token?

P2P on/off ramping is essential financial infrastructure in emerging markets. Without a token, control over this infrastructure stays with a single operator who can change fees, censor users, or shut it down. The token transfers that control to the community.

## Is this an ownership token?

Yes. This is protocol ownership, distinct from equity in a traditional company. The "Why the Token Exists" section above covers the full ownership thesis.

## How does the MetaDAO-style sale work?

Users commit USDC during a 4-day window. If oversubscribed, allocations are pro-rata. Existing protocol users with XP get priority. No private rounds happen at TGE. The sale is the primary distribution event.

## What unlocks at TGE?

10M sale tokens + 2.9M liquidity tokens (12.9M total, 50% of supply). Zero investor or team tokens unlock at launch.

## How does treasury-funded value accrual work?

20% of protocol revenue flows to the on-chain treasury, planned to increase to 35% as the protocol matures—subject to MetaDAO futarchy governance. Token holders decide how to deploy these funds. Buy-and-burn is one approved mechanism—tokens purchased on the open market and sent to the zero address. The treasury is funded entirely by real transaction revenue from a working product. More protocol usage means a larger treasury and stronger governance-directed value accrual.

## Is supply fixed?

Yes, fixed at launch (25.8M). Future issuance requires governance approval via futarchy. The protocol runs on transaction revenue, not token emissions.

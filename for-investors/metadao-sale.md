The $P2P token launches through a MetaDAO-style sale mechanism designed for fair, community-first distribution.

1. Users commit USDC during a 4-day commitment window
2. Founders set a discretionary cap on total raise accepted
3. If oversubscribed, allocations and refunds are distributed pro-rata
4. 10M tokens are distributed proportionally among all participants at launch
5. Post-sale, the treasury provides 20% of raised USDC and 2.9M tokens to liquidity pools
6. Mint authority transfers to the market-governed treasury

Existing protocol users with XP receive allocations and priority access.

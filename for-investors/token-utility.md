**Ownership.** $P2P is an ownership token. Protocol IP, treasury funds, and mint authority are all controlled by token holders through futarchy-based governance—not by any single team, foundation, or entity. This means the token carries real, enforceable ownership: if resources were ever misappropriated, governance provides the mechanism to redirect control. Decisions that affect token supply (minting) must pass through a prediction-market governance mechanism, where participants stake real capital on whether a proposal increases or decreases token value. Proposals that the market predicts will harm value are automatically rejected.

**Governance.** Token holders vote on protocol parameters such as fees, limits, merchant rules, oracle configs, and treasury allocation. One staked $P2P = one vote, with delegation.

**Staking.** Circle Admins stake $P2P to operate merchant networks. Community members delegate $P2P to Circles to participate in revenue sharing. Merchants stake USDC as working capital. The staking design creates skin-in-the-game at every layer.

**Fee distribution.** Protocol revenue is routed across participants.

| Recipient | Share of Revenue |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Merchants + Delegators | 53.33% |
| Treasury | 20%, planned increase to 35% (governed via MetaDAO futarchy) |
| Insurance Pools | 17.78% |
| Circle Admins | 8.89% |

No single party captures a majority of protocol revenue. Merchants earn the most because they provide working capital and operational labor. Treasury contributions connect token value to protocol usage—governance can direct these funds toward buy-and-burn or other value-accruing measures via MetaDAO futarchy. Insurance pools exist so disputes don't become externalised costs.

**Governance.** Token holders vote on protocol parameters such as fees, limits, merchant rules, oracle configs, and treasury allocation. One staked $P2P = one vote, with delegation.

**Staking.** Circle Admins stake $P2P to operate merchant networks. Community members delegate $P2P to Circles to participate in revenue sharing. Merchants stake USDC as working capital. The staking design creates skin-in-the-game at every layer.

**Fee distribution.** Protocol revenue is routed across participants.

| Recipient | Share of Revenue |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Merchants + Delegators | 53.33% |
| Buy-and-Burn | 20% (increasing to 33% via governance) |
| Insurance Pools | 17.78% |
| Circle Admins | 8.89% |

No single party captures a majority of protocol revenue. Merchants earn the most because they provide working capital and operational labor. Buy-and-burn connects token value to protocol usage. Insurance pools exist so disputes don't become externalised costs.

- **Working core rails exist today.** Onramp/offramp, matching, disputes, and on-chain parameter controls are live and processing volume.
- **Expansion path is clear.** Remittance and multi-currency tracks build on existing rails. They add corridors and users, not new trust assumptions.
- **Early-stage structure.** Compact launch supply with no insider tokens at TGE.
- **Governance transition path.** Admin-operated today, with a documented multi-phase migration to token-governed control.
- **Value capture is explicit.** Staking, delegation, and treasury contributions connect protocol revenue to token economics.
